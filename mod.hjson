'''
Discover and explore a brand new planet with its own campaign: Xanthia, a mountainous hot planet with more dangers and threat hiding there.

Remember that Xanthia is in beta test right now. Everything is subject to change.

And please, try to download it not from releases due to releases can have unfounded bugs but latest version of the mod could have fixed that.
